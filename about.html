        <h3>My Journey & Impact</h3>
        <p>
          My passion for technology began in high school, when I built my first website for my cybersecurity club. Seeing how a simple online presence helped increase students awareness regarding cybersecurity and privacy inspired me to use my skills for practical change.

        <p>
          During my education at high school, I worked in a team to redesign a client’s e-commerce platform, resulting in a significant increase in user engagement. At my high school, I participated in various workshops and group projects that made me stand out from the crowd.

          I believe technology should empower people. Whether it’s simplifying user experiences or making digital tools more accessible, I strive to create solutions that make a real difference.
